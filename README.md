# Bank Management System

This is a simple **Bank Management System** implemented in Java, demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**.

## Features

- **Account Class (Abstraction & Encapsulation)**
  - Private properties: `accountNumber`, `balance`, `ownerName`
  - Public methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `getBalance()`
  - Protected method: `setBalance()` to allow controlled access for subclasses

- **SavingsAccount (Inheritance)**
  - Adds `interestRate`
  - Method `applyInterest()` to apply interest on balance

- **CurrentAccount (Inheritance)**
  - Adds `overdraftLimit`
  - Method `setOverdraftLimit()` to configure overdraft
  - Overrides `withdraw()` to allow overdraft within limits

- **Bank Class (Polymorphism)**
  - Manages multiple accounts
  - Allows deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking for any account type

## Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP Principles

â”‚â”€â”€ SavingsAccount.java   # Subclass with interest rate (Inheritance)
â”‚â”€â”€ CurrentAccount.java   # Subclass with overdraft limit (Inheritance & Polymorphism)
â”‚â”€â”€ Bank.java             # Manages multiple accounts (Polymorphism)
â”‚â”€â”€ App.java             # Entry point to test the system
